"# meetup_2" 
This is the second meetup for the Kampalr group. Following the feedback from the first meetup, attendees had wanted to understand how to import and clean data from a typical dataset. 

We focused on the importing and cleaning data using a dataset from data.ug on PLE results by district from 2010 - 2016. Our thought process for this brief class is documented in the Rmarkdown file.
